In his discussion of clause functions, Charles F. Meyer offers a thorough analysis of their occurrence in English, examining the interactions between different syntactic elements inside a clause's structure.  Meyer begins by observing that, unlike pronouns which are marked morphologically for their grammatical roles (for instance, _I_ as the subject and _me_ as the object), noun phrases in English do not have such distinct indicators. Therefore, a noun phrase's functional role **must** be inferred from its syntactic location, its relationship to the verb (the predicator), and its behavior during transformational processes like **passivization** and **subject–verb agreement**.

Meyer also examines how subjects and predicators are essential to clause form, especially when it comes to declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentence kinds. However, he clarifies that while the predicator is fulfilled by verbal elements (both lexical and auxiliary), the subject can take on various forms, often manifested as a noun phrase or clause. When it comes to declarative sentences, the subject usually comes before the predicator. In interrogative sentences, the operator is inverted with the subject in order to identify the subject position in ambiguous constructions. The introduction of do-support in questions and negations is emphasized as a relatively modern change in English, becoming prominent during Early Modern English. 

The passage goes on to discuss different sentence types, highlighting that while declarative sentences are prevalent in written forms like business letters, interrogatives and imperatives are typical in spontaneous speech due to its interactive nature. Meyer notes that exclamatory sentences are restrictive in form, only starting with _what_ or _how_, followed by specific syntactic arrangements.

In contrast, imperatives can be expressed with just a single verb in its base form, with the second person subject _you_ usually being implied. The focus then shifts to objects and complements. Meyer differentiates between direct and indirect objects, based on the transitivity of verbs and syntactic tests such as passivization and pronominal positioning. Direct objects follow monotransitive verbs and can be elevated to the subject role in passive forms, while indirect objects occur with ditransitive verbs and can be restated in structures prefaced by _to_ or _for_. Complements are categorized into subject complements, which are connected to the subject, and object complements, which typically appear with verbs like _find_, _consider_, or _make_.

Meyer concludes his discussion of adverbials by emphasizing that, in contrast to adverbs, which stand for a word class, adverbials create a clause function that can be conveyed through a variety of phrase types, such as clauses, prepositional phrases, and noun phrases. Referencing **Biber et al**. (1999), Meyer classifies adverbials into circumstance, stance, and linking categories. Circumstance adverbials are closely tied to the clause and respond to queries like _how_, _when_, _where_, and _why_. Stance adverbials convey the speaker’s or writer’s perspective toward the proposition, while linking adverbials highlight logical connections between clauses or sentences. Through extensive examples and syntactic analysis, Meyer demonstrates that recognizing clause functions in English is based on an interaction of grammatical, positional, and transformational elements rather than fixed forms.
