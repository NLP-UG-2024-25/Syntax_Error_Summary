**Introducing English Linguistics: Chapter 5 English Syntax Summary**
# Marysia's Part
Chapter five begins by shifting the focus from pragmatics to **syntax**, which deals with how grammatical constructions are formed rather than why they are used in specific contexts. A central concept in syntax is **constituency** — the idea that elements in a sentence are grouped into structured units at various levels: **sentences**, **clauses**, **phrases**, and **words**. Constituents can be either **immediate** (larger groupings like subject and predicate) or **ultimate** (individual words). To test whether a group of words forms a constituent, linguists apply methods such as **insertion** (placing an adverb like *probably*), **substitution** (e.g. using pronouns) and **movement** (reordering parts of a sentence). These diagnostics help reveal the internal structure of language. The chapter contrasts **notional** definitions, which rely on meaning (e.g. a noun is a “thing”), with **formal** definitions, which focus on structure, such as suffixes or syntactic position. Formal criteria are preferred in modern linguistics due to their consistency and reliability. This is illustrated through examples like Lewis Carroll’s *Jabberwocky*, where readers assign word classes not through meaning but through form. English syntax exhibits both **linear** and **hierarchical** structure, and ambiguity can arise depending on how words are grouped—for instance, *foreign language specialist* may have multiple interpretations.

Constituents are described by both their **form** (such as noun phrase, verb phrase) and **function** (such as subject, object, complement). A clear example is found in *"The child is healthy"*, where *healthy* is an adjective phrase functioning as a subject complement. The structure of **noun phrases (NPs)** is then explored in detail. A noun phrase typically includes a **head noun or pronoun**, optionally preceded by **determiners** (e.g. *the*, *every*) and **adjective phrases**, and followed by **prepositional phrases** or **relative clauses**. Nouns themselves may be **countable** (*tables*, *children*), **uncountable** (*furniture*, *freedom*), or irregular. Morphological markers such as plural endings, suffixes like *-ion* or *-ity*, and historical borrowings help to classify them. **Pronouns**, which also act as NP heads, carry distinctions absent in nouns — such as **person**, **case**, **number**, and **reflexive/possessive** forms (*I/me*, *she/her*, *mine*, *ourselves*). Some pronouns, like *you*, are used in both singular and plural contexts, though regional variants like *y’all* or *youse* help distinguish them. Noun phrases frequently contain **embedded** structures, and repeated embedding gives rise to **recursion** — a key property of natural language that allows the nesting of one phrase within another.

The chapter also introduces the structure of **verb phrases (VPs)**. A VP typically consists of a **main lexical verb** and may include one or more **auxiliary verbs**, arranged in a fixed order: modal auxiliary, primary auxiliary, and finally the lexical verb (e.g. *can be read*). Lexical verbs fall into **regular** (e.g. *walk/walked*) and **irregular** (e.g. *drink/drank*) categories and appear in various forms: base, -s form, -ed past, -ed participle, and -ing participle. These verb forms, along with auxiliaries, are essential components of English syntax, enabling expressions of time, aspect, voice, and modality. Verb phrases, like noun phrases, are central to understanding sentence structure, and their internal composition reflects broader grammatical rules governing English clause construction.

Unlike the regular verbs, irregular verbs **don't** always have the same endings. Their stems are also not constant and they often contain **internal vowel changes**, e.g. *fight* becomes *fought* in the past tense. Still, there are certain patterns to irregular verbs, like **the number of different forms of a verb** and **similarities in the change of vowels**. For example *drink* and *ring* both have five different forms and undergo identical vowel changes. *Be* is a special example, as it has **eight** different forms - the greatest number any verb has, because it makes special distinctions unlike other verbs, like between **person** (*am*, *are*, *is*), or between singular and plural subjects in past tense (*was*, *were*).

Lexical verbs are an **open class**, which means that new lexical verbs still appear in the English language. On the other hand, auxiliary verbs are members of a **closed class** - they're finite in number. Primary auxiliaries like *be* and *have* are **marked for number** and indicate the **progressive** and **perfective** aspect respectively. However, the primary auxiliary *do* has a different role: it occurs in certain types of **questions** and **negated sentences**. For example in the sentences "Why *did* the Vietnamese ultimately *fight* on?" and "I *did* not *pick* her *up*". In both *did* has no real meaning besides forming a **question** or **negation**. That's why in some grammars it is reffered to as **dummy *do***. It can also be used to **emphasize** the message: "I *do* like to hear you talk".

Apart from the **primary auxiliaries** there are also two types of **modal auxiliaries**: **central** (*may*, *can*, *will*) and **phrasal** (*be going to*, *have to*). An expression like *be going to* is considered a modal, becasue, just like *will*, it expresses **future time** and **occurs in the beginning of the verb phrase**. Still, depending on context, they **can't** be used interchangeably. Additionaly, unlike primary auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries are typically **not marked for number or tense**. For example, the modal *must* has the same form with a singular and plural subject. Moreover, modals like *can* and *could* differ not in **tense** but in **meaning**. Substituting them for each other **doesn't** change the tense in a sentence, but it **does** affect the meaning. By asking "*can* you?", you request a "yes" or "no" answer, but askin "*could* you" turns the question into a polite request. Only **one** modal auxiliary at a time can occur in a verb phrase, but there can be **multiple** primary auxiliaries, e.g. *have been* following *may* ("*May have been* murdered"). It is possible to find up to **three** primary auxiliaries following the modal, but such occurrences are rare.

Considering the restriction that the **verb phrase** consists of only an **obligatory lexical verb** and one or more **optional auxiliary verbs**, in a tree diagram of a sentence *"I called my mother"* there would be **two** separate noun phrases (*"I"* and *"my mother"*) and **one** verb phrase (*"called"*). However, there are alternative views on the matter, considering *"called my mother"* to be a **single unit**, because it can be substituted with the pro-verb *do*. For a question: *"Did you call your mother?"*, *"Yes, I *did*"* is a possible answer. Authors of that view also provide additional evidence for including other elements such as **adverb phrases** in the **verb phrase**, presenting an example: *only*. It may become a part of a **noun phrase**, as in "The *only* one", so it should also become a part of a **verb phrase** in "can *only* choose", making the verb phrase *discontinuous* if it wasn't allowed.

Adverbs are a very **heterogenous form class**. Many of them and with a suffix ***-ly***, introducing a first class, but it's not a rule. **Time adverbs** like *momentarily* or *recently* end with that suffix, but *now* and *then* don't. Moreover, words like *lovely* are not **adverbs** but **adjectives**, but they also have a suffix *-ly*. Other adverb-types are: **maanner adverbs** (*skillfully* - *in a skillful manner*) and **content disjuncts** (*inevitably*), adverbs used by a speaker to comment on the content of their speech. It's common for adverbs to be one word in length, but they can be **intensified** by the same adverbs used to intensify adjectives: *very*, *somewhat*, *quite*. **Conjunctive adverbs** (*therefore*, *however*) appear close to the start of a clause and they establish links between parts of text.

In his chapter on _clauses, sentences, and clause functions_, Charles F. Meyer provides a foundation for English syntax through an examination of how **clauses** and **sentences** are constructed and how they function in larger syntactic structures. He defines clauses and sentences not only in terms of their **structural composition** but also in terms of their **function** in discourse.

A **clause** is a syntactic unit that minimally consists of **a predicator** and **a subject**. The predicator, as realised by a verb phrase, is to a great extent responsible for the argument structure of the clause—that is, the number and kinds of other clause functions that can co-occur. For instance, the intransitive verb _died_ requires only a subject, but the ditransitive verb _gave_ requires a subject, a direct object, and an indirect object. Clause functions are therefore highly reliant on the **lexical properties** of the main verb. In addition to the predicator, Meyer recognizes several core clause functions: **subject**, **object** (direct or indirect), **complement** (subject or object), and **adverbial**. These functions are not only identified by their syntactic position—e.g., subjects usually precede the verb—but also by other linguistic processes such as passivization, which can transform a direct object into the subject of a passive sentence.

Meyer then identifies two general types of clauses: **main clauses** and **subordinate clauses**. A main clause will bear a **finite verb** (marked for tense) and may be used independently. Subordinate clauses, by contrast, cannot be independent and are either grammatically or semantically dependent on a main clause. Subordination is marked either by a **subordinating conjunction** (_when_, _if_, _because_) or by the presence of a **non-finite verb** (_thinking_, _taken_, _to choose_). He also classifies subordinate clauses into **non-finite clauses** (containing participles or infinitives), **finite clauses introduced by conjunctions**, **relative clauses** (introduced by _who_, _which_, _that_, etc.), and **verbless clauses**, which lack an overt verb but imply one contextually.

The chapter also addresses the syntactic process of **coordination**, in which structurally parallel elements are linked by _and_, _or_, or _but_. Unlike subordination, coordination combines equal syntactic units. Meyer illustrates coordination of noun phrases, verb phrases, and clauses. He also discusses such phenomena as **ellipsis** and **gapping**, where reiterated material in a second coordinated unit is omitted for economy. For example, in "muggers might lurk and accidents [ ] wait to happen," the auxiliary _might_ is understood in the second conjunct.

Meyer emphasizes throughout the discussion the importance of observing how syntactic structure and grammatical functions interact. His discussion elicits both form (e.g., verb forms and types of clauses) and function (e.g., subject, object) in describing how English clauses function in sentences. The section gives students a theoretical and practical foundation for identification and analysis of complicated sentence structures in English.

In his discussion of clause functions, Charles F. Meyer offers a thorough analysis of their occurrence in English, examining the interactions between different syntactic elements inside a clause's structure.  Meyer begins by observing that, unlike pronouns which are marked morphologically for their grammatical roles (for instance, _I_ as the subject and _me_ as the object), noun phrases in English do not have such distinct indicators. Therefore, a noun phrase's functional role **must** be inferred from its syntactic location, its relationship to the verb (the predicator), and its behavior during transformational processes like **passivization** and **subject–verb agreement**.

Meyer also examines how subjects and predicators are essential to clause form, especially when it comes to declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentence kinds. However, he clarifies that while the predicator is fulfilled by verbal elements (both lexical and auxiliary), the subject can take on various forms, often manifested as a noun phrase or clause. When it comes to declarative sentences, the subject usually comes before the predicator. In interrogative sentences, the operator is inverted with the subject in order to identify the subject position in ambiguous constructions. The introduction of do-support in questions and negations is emphasized as a relatively modern change in English, becoming prominent during Early Modern English. 

The passage goes on to discuss different sentence types, highlighting that while declarative sentences are prevalent in written forms like business letters, interrogatives and imperatives are typical in spontaneous speech due to its interactive nature. Meyer notes that exclamatory sentences are restrictive in form, only starting with _what_ or _how_, followed by specific syntactic arrangements.

In contrast, imperatives can be expressed with just a single verb in its base form, with the second person subject _you_ usually being implied. The focus then shifts to objects and complements. Meyer differentiates between direct and indirect objects, based on the transitivity of verbs and syntactic tests such as passivization and pronominal positioning. Direct objects follow monotransitive verbs and can be elevated to the subject role in passive forms, while indirect objects occur with ditransitive verbs and can be restated in structures prefaced by _to_ or _for_. Complements are categorized into subject complements, which are connected to the subject, and object complements, which typically appear with verbs like _find_, _consider_, or _make_.

Meyer concludes his discussion of adverbials by emphasizing that, in contrast to adverbs, which stand for a word class, adverbials create a clause function that can be conveyed through a variety of phrase types, such as clauses, prepositional phrases, and noun phrases. Referencing **Biber et al**. (1999), Meyer classifies adverbials into circumstance, stance, and linking categories. Circumstance adverbials are closely tied to the clause and respond to queries like _how_, _when_, _where_, and _why_. Stance adverbials convey the speaker’s or writer’s perspective toward the proposition, while linking adverbials highlight logical connections between clauses or sentences. Through extensive examples and syntactic analysis, Meyer demonstrates that recognizing clause functions in English is based on an interaction of grammatical, positional, and transformational elements rather than fixed forms.
